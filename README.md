# Advantages of the miner

* NET Framework 4.8 C# Miner has selective injection into Windows processes 
* Stealth - pauses the miner and resets the GPU memory while any of the system monitor and startup manager programs is open
* Checks if you have administrator rights, if yes: then set autoloader, if no: write Windows registry
* Mining on CPU and GPU - both CPU and GPU can be mined (all depends on the video memory of the device)
* Windows Defender Exclusions - Can add exclusions into Windows Defender after being started to avoid being detected
* Includes the ability to put a clipper on your wallet
* The miner allows you to work as a loader, in case you want to merge your build with the miner's build
* Web panel support - Has support for monitoring all miners in a free standalone web panel.

# Web Panel
You can find the web panel that the miner officially supports here: [VolVeRWebPanel](https://github.com/VolVeRFM/VolVeRWebPanel) The web panel can be used for miner statistics, status, connection settings, and more.

# The documentation
The builder itself can cause a lot of errors, since it has a beta-test version.

Please download all the dependencies and resources you need to work with the builder yourself

Always check your target 4.8 environment.
